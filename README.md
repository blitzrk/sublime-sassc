# Sublime-SassC

This package provides the `sassc` binary for Sublime Text (2 and 3) packages. [PackageControl](https://packagecontrol.io/) will automatically put the directory containing the binary in Python's `sys.path`.

Build scripts will eventually be added for all systems. I will try my best to update the binaries at the start of each month. However, feel free to send PRs at any time. I will merge and update the tag.
